1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.

	My most proud professional acchievement is been to continously learn coding in different languages, starting with Java a long time ago.  Solving problems and
	automating taks thorough code is something that everyday brings me joy and pride.

2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github
Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)

	I read that Microsoft is resucitaing the Remote Method Invocation under a different name that scapes me at the moment.  That avenue to do communications between C# apps was something else.
	

3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?

	Grandma when you go to the doctor you in most cases will your insurance to pay for the doctor's visit.  At the doctor's office, the check your insurance and 
	for that they use software.  Software is that funny bunch of squares and boxes that show on the computer screen and that does something in particular.
	
	Availity makes software so that your doctor and insurance company can communicate your visits  faster and more efficiently with your doctors, but also you 
	you may check your visits and claims too.
